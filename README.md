# Artificially Intelligent Food Assistant for the Visually Impaired

Our system is an interface which utilizes many advancements in Artificial Intelligence to make visual evaluations of a variety of both fresh and packaged food for the visually impaired.

## Dependencies

You will first need to install the anaconda package manager.\
You can follow the instructions by clicking the [Anaconda Installing Guide](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html)\
Optionally, You can follow [Miniconda Installing Guide](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)\
Any other package manager will work only if it can install all the packages in our requirements files

Once you have a package manager, It is suggested to just run the inference scripts as delineated by the instructions below, and whenever
you have an ImportError: No module named ..., then you install the package using your package manager.\
**For anaconda, every package other than the effdet package was installed through anaconda. Install the effdet package using PyPI over [here](https://pypi.org/project/effdet/)**






Add a Readme file explaining the the food aid project
Update Token

(Provide Google Collab link to very easy to use collab file)

In root have train.py file

Requirements:
* Working inference script where user can plug in model weights and get output
* Read me on how to run inference script with params and can attach image or mp4.
* all the dataset and train .py scripts with comments.
* requirements.txt
* Add Readme to each folder
* Link to webcam and stuff

* Move dataset and engine and train to another folder called references and then have the inference files that can be used and played with outside. To form inference script use the inference functions asnd then for ssd lite and mob net they should be same and then for efficientdet you can create it. Add parse arger for choosing images. Then for references add a readme that explains the thing below.

## Write code for a way to infer on images using weight files in device and then explian how to use that code in the READme

## Write how the train code is just there for reference and can't really be used maybe in the train readme. Also say what the dataset .py scripts do and mention how to build own train scripts around them.
