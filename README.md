# Visually-Impaired-Food-Device-Aid-
Add a Readme file explaining the the food aid project


(Provide Google Collab link to very easy to use collab file)

In root have train.py file 

Requirements: 
* Working inference script where user can plug in model weights and get output
* Read me on how to run inference script with params and can attach image or mp4. 
* all the dataset and train .py scripts with comments. 
* requirements.txt
* Add Readme to each folder
* Link to notebook to show how pipeline works like training and dataset works.

* Move dataset and engine and train to another folder called references and then have the inference files that can be used and played with outside. To form inference script use the inference functions asnd then for ssd lite and mob net they should be same and then for efficientdet you can create it. Add parse arger for choosing images. Then for references add a readme that explains the thing below.

## Write code for a way to infer on images using weight files in device and then explian how to use that code in the READme

## Write how the train code is just there for reference and can't really be used maybe in the train readme. Also say what the dataset .py scripts do and mention how to build own train scripts around them.
